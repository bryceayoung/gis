    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's lab, we'll be using data from the U.S. Census Bureau on housing, income, and migration. I've prepared county-level data and data on \"Census Places\" (towns, cities, and other developed areas) from two surveys:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year summary for 2017\n",
    "- The American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year summary for 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "The ACS is conducted more frequently than the decennial census, allowing for more frequent studies of how communities are changing. However, they are less accurate than the decennial census because they use only a small sample from each enumeration area.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some other things you should consider when interpreting these data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The 5-year ACS is an average of small samples over a 5-year period, centered on the report year: the \"2017\" ACS includes data from 2015-2019 and the \"2021\" ACS includes data from 2019-2023.\n",
    "- The Place-based estimates aggregate over potentially large areas; for example, there is a single median home sale price for all of Missoula.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For these reasons, when comparing ACS estimates over time, we tend to get results that underestimate the magnitude of change** (essentially, the data are smoothed). If we were really interested in studying change over multiple cities, we should use decennial Census data. If we were interested in studying change in a specific place (like Missoula), we should probably use finer-scale data, like data at the level of Census tracts or block groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "**The `df.housing` data frame** includes the following fields:\n",

    "- `pop.total` - Total population\n",
    "- `households` - Total number of households\n",

    "- `median.owner.household.income.2021.USD` - Median household income among non-renter households (in 2021 dollars)\n",
    "\n",
    "**And in the `df.migration` data frame:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `state.code` - Two letter U.S. state code, [see reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_and_territory_abbreviations#ANSI_standard_INCITS_38:2009)\n",

    "### Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Gross rent\"** refers to the combined cost of rent and utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a household is paying 30% or more of its income toward (gross) rent, we would describe that household as **rent-burdened.** Rent-burdened households may have difficulty paying for food, health care, or other important things, because so much of their income is being spent on housing.\n",
