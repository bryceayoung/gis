Today we'll wrap-up our discussion of analyzing and cleaning tabular data using `dplyr` pipelines. [We'll use data from the Data Carpentry lesson on R,](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/#Download_the_data) which is a great resource for you to revisit if you want to refresh your R knowledge.

**Download the data (3 CSV files):**

- [surveys.zip](http://files.ntsg.umt.edu/data/GIS_Programming/data/surveys.zip)

**Install the `lubridate` and `tidyr` packages:**

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c('lubridate', 'tidyr'))
```

```{r}
surveys <- read.csv('surveys.csv')
```

How is order established in a dplyr pipeline?

```{r}
surveys %>%
  arrange(-year) %>%
  # arrange(desc(year)) %>% This is the same as above

# We can also arrange by multiple columns
surveys %>%
  arrange(year, month, day) %>%
  head

# We can order rows by alphanumeric columns, too
surveys %>%
  arrange(species_id, year, month, day) %>%
  head

# With each species, what is the FIRST year that we caught it
surveys %>%
  arrange(year, month, day) %>%
  group_by(species_id) %>%
  summarize(year = first(year)) # The argument in summarize() needs to return a single value

# Can group and then ungroup
surveys %>%
  arrange(year, month, day) %>%
  group_by(species_id) %>%
  summarize(year = first(year)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

Working with dates and times in R

```{r}
head(surveys)

date <- as.Date('2023-04-06') #ISO standard YYYY-MM-DD
class(date)

library(lubridate)

?base::union

make_date(2023, 4, 6)

# Challenge: create a date column that combines year, month, day
names(surveys)

surveys %>%
  mutate(date = make_date(year, month, day)) %>% # This expression make_date is done auto for every row
  head


# Another way to use mutate
surveys %>%
  mutate(hfoot_length2)
```



## Joining Tables

![](relational_joins.png)

In a left-join, we're keeping all rows in the left table, and adding all the rows with
matching values in the right table.

```{r}
# These have common columns that enable us to join them by that column (species_id)
plots <- read.csv('plots.csv')
species <- read.csv('species.csv')

surveys %>%
  left_join(species, by = 'species_id') %>% # column name needs to be provided as a string
  nrow

surveys %>%
  right_join(species, by = 'species_id') %>% # column name needs to be provided as a string
  nrow

```
